    "text": "1.2 Bayesian Interpretation of Uncertainty\nInstead of viewing probabilities in terms of the frequencies of random, repeatable events, what is referred as the frequentist interpretation of probability, one can see them as proxy for uncertainty quantification. That means, that new events serve as new data points – evidence! – for improving the understanding of uncertainty in a process of interest.\n\n1.2.1 Bayes Equation\nLet us first formally define the Bayes equation.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Bayes Rule) The probability of an event \\(y\\) happening, conditioned on knowing that event \\(x\\) happened can be expressed in the following form: \\[\n\\overbrace{p(y\\vert x)}^\\text{posterior}=\\frac{\\overbrace{p(x\\vert y)}^\\text{likelihood}\\overbrace{p(y)}^\\text{prior}}{\\underbrace{p(x)}_\\text{normalizing term}}.\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\n\nThe events \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be understood as outcomes of the random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively. Random variables are functions that maps our event space \\(\\Omega\\) to event outcomes, e.g., \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). When we write \\(p(X=x)\\) we are referring to the probability that the random variable function \\(X\\) is evaluated to \\(x\\). When the context is clear, we can abuse the notation and just write \\(p(x)\\) or \\(p(y)\\).\nTheorem 1.1 is a consequence of two important probability rules: sum rule and product rule.\n\n\n1.2.2 Probability rules: Sum Rule and Product Rule\nThe sum rule is also known as Law of Total Probability. Bishop (2006) expresses them as:\n\nTheorem 1.2 (Sum rule/Law of Total Probability) \\[\np(X) = \\sum_Y p(X,Y)\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\n\n\nTheorem 1.3 (Product Rule/Definition of Conditional Probability) \\[\np(X,Y)=p(Y\\vert X)p(X)\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nWhere \\(p(X,Y)\\) is the joint probability of random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), also commonly expressed as their intersection \\(p(X\\cap Y)\\).\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Developing the Intuition For Understanding Uncertainty\nLooking at Equation 1.1, we see that the probability of \\(y\\) happening given that \\(x\\) happened depends on the probability of what we knew before about the process, \\(p(x)\\), which is commonly referred as the priors and the likelihood of it happening, \\(p(x\\vert y)\\). What we compute is the posterior, that is, the updated probability of \\(y\\) happening given \\(x\\) having happened.\nIn the next section, we will explore examples of classification and regression problems where we can apply the Bayesian interpretation for understanding uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\nBishop, Christopher M. 2006.

    "text": "3.1 Extending the example with online update\nTo make the discussion concrete, consider the following toy scenario. Suppose that, historically, \\(2\\%\\) of the parts produced by the machine turn out defective (a really bad rate, but useful for the demonstration). This means: \\[\np(d)=0.02\n\\]\nWe also happen to know from historical data that when a defect is present, the current sensor raises a flag \\(90\\%\\) of the time, but it also generates false alarms: even when the part is fine, it still flags \\(15\\%\\) of the time. Formally: \\[\np(f\\vert d)  = 0.9 \\text{, }\np(f\\vert nd) = 0.15\n\\]\nFrom Equation 1.3 and Equation 1.2, we can compute \\(p(f)\\):\n\\[\np(f)=p(f\\vert d)p(d) + p(f\\vert nd)p(nd)\n\\]\nBayes’ rule lets us update the belief about a part being defective as soon as the sensor fires. Applying Equation 1.1 and since \\(Y\\) can only assume one of the values in the set \\(\\{d,nd\\}\\), i.e., \\(p(nd)=1-p(d)\\), we have the following equation in function of the variables we already know:\n\\[\np(d\\vert f)=\\frac{p(f\\vert d)p(d)}{p(f)}=\\frac{p(f\\vert d)p(d)}{p(f\\vert d)p(d) + p(f\\vert nd)(1-p(d))}\n\\]\nThis computes to \\(p(d\\vert f) =\\) 0.11, which is still surprisingly low given our prior and likelihood. The method, however, forces us to be realistic in our belief and say that we either need more evidence to prove \\(A\\) as a metric for \\(Y\\) or we should pivot to other experiments. Since our result depended so strongly on our choice of priors, we can assume that reliably collecting this information is critically important for significant outcomes using the method. Indeed, this is a common critique about the Bayesian approach to probability: it’s often more difficult to be reproduced in comparison to frequentist approaches, since the research outcome depends heavily on these initial assumptions.\nThe previous example computed an analytical estimate for our posterior, making no explicit assumption about the underlying probability distribution of the prior and likelihood, treating them as fixed point estimates based on historical data.\nThe bayesian approach conceptualizes probabilities as uncertainty. This is useful for online learning scenarios, where part of the dataset is encountered during runtime. In order to apply online learning to Example 3.1, let us first formally define our new learning task:\n\\[\np(\\theta_{f,d} \\vert \\ \\mathcal{D}_f)=?\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\theta_{f,d}\\) is the probability of the part being defective given the sensor reading, \\(\\mathcal{D}_f=\\{D_1, D_2, \\dots, D_i\\}\\) is the set of observations of \\(D\\) outcomes when \\(F=f\\). Interestingly, \\(\\theta_{f,d}\\) is both a probability and a random variable itself, since we are uncertain about its value.\nWe can once again express our task in terms of the bayesian equation (Equation 1.1), but now making use of proportionality since, for the moment, we are not interested in the normalizing constant \\(p(\\mathcal{D}_f)\\): \\[\n\\begin{align*}\np(\\theta_{f,d} \\vert \\ \\mathcal{D}_f)&\\propto p(\\mathcal{D}_f\\vert \\theta_{f,d})p(\\theta_{f,d}) \\\\\n&\\propto p(\\mathcal{D}_f\\vert \\theta_{f,d})(\\theta_{f,d})\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]",

    "text": "3.1.1 Modelling the prior and likelihood as beta-bernoulli distributions\nNow, we need ways to express both our likelihood and prior as probability distributions, instead of point estimates, since we want to update our belief as new data points are observed. For that, we use the concept of conjugate priors, which are pairs of probability distributions that, when used together in Bayes’ rule, yield a posterior distribution of the same family as the prior distribution. This property greatly simplifies the process of updating beliefs with new evidence.\nIn our case, we can use the Beta distribution as our prior and the Bernoulli distribution as our likelihood. Specifically, we can model the prior distribution of \\(\\theta_{f,d}\\) as a Beta distribution, \\(Beta(a, b)\\), and the likelihood of the observed data as a Bernoulli distribution, \\(Ber(\\theta_{f,d})\\).\n\\[\n\\mathcal{D}_f\\vert \\theta_{f,d} \\sim Ber(\\theta_{f,d})\n\\] \\[\n\\theta_{f,d} \\sim Beta(a, b)\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\sim\\) means that the random variable follows the probability distribution on the right side. The Beta distribution is defined on the interval \\([0, 1]\\) and is parameterized by two positive shape parameters, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), commonly referred as hyperparameters and they are used to encode our beliefs into the prior distribution. It is often used to model the distribution of probabilities. The Bernoulli distribution, on the other hand, models binary outcomes (success/failure) and is parameterized by a single probability parameter \\(\\theta\\).\nWe can write our likelihood and prior as: \\[p(\\mathcal{D}_f\\vert \\theta_{f,d})=\\theta_{f,d}^{N_{f,d}}(1-\\theta_{f,d})^{N_{f,nd}}\\] \\[p(\\theta_{f,d})\\propto \\theta_{f,d}^{a-1}(1-\\theta_{f,d})^{b-1}\\]\nHere, \\(N_{f,d}\\) and \\(N_{f,nd}\\) are the counts of flagged defective and non-defective events. Plugging in these expressions into Equation 3.1, we get: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\np(\\theta_{f,d} \\vert \\ \\mathcal{D}_f)&\\propto Ber(\\theta_{f,d})Beta(a, b) \\\\\n&\\propto \\theta_{f,d}^{N_{f,d}}(1-\\theta_{f,d})^{N_{f,nd}}\\theta_{f,d}^{a-1}(1-\\theta_{f,d})^{b-1} \\\\\n&\\propto \\theta_{f,d}^{N_{f,d}+a-1}(1-\\theta_{f,d})^{N_{f,nd}+b-1} \\\\\n&\\propto Beta(a+N_{f,d}, b+N_{f,nd})\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nWe see that the posterior also follows a Beta distribution, with updated parameters \\(a+N_{f,d}\\) and \\(b+N_{f,nd}\\). This means that we can update our belief about the probability of a part being defective by simply updating the parameters of the Beta distribution as we observe new data. Therefore, Bayesian inference can be used both sequentially or in batch mode with equivalent results, which it makes it suitable for online learning scenarios. For a proof of this property, see Murphy (2014). From Murphy’s book, we can also look at useful properties of the Beta distribution, such as its mean, mode and variance: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\theta]=\\frac{a}{a+b}, \\quad mode(\\theta)=\\frac{a-1}{a+b-2}, \\quad Var(\\theta)=\\frac{ab}{(a+b)^2(a+b+1)}\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nBased on that, we can compute the mode, or MAP estimate, of our posterior distribution as: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{\\theta}_{f,d}\\vert \\ \\mathcal{D}_f&=\\frac{a+N_{f,d}-1}{a+b+N_{f,d}+N_{f,nd}-2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{a+N_{f,d}-1}{a+b+N_f-2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nWhere \\(N_f=N_{f,d}+N_{f,nd}\\) is the total number of flagged events. Let us plot the prior, likelihood and posterior distributions for our initial example. We can choose the hyperparameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that the prior mean matches our initial belief of \\(p(d)=0.02\\). A good choice is to set \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=98\\), which gives us the same prior mean of \\(2/(2+98)=0.02\\). For the likelihood, we can use the counts of flagged defective and non-defective events based on our initial example. Assuming we observed \\(90\\) flagged defective events and \\(15\\) flagged non-defective events, we have \\(N_{f,d}=90\\) and \\(N_{f,nd}=15\\). Thus, our posterior will have parameters \\(a+N_{f,d}=2+90=92\\) and \\(b+N_{f,nd}=98+15=113\\).",

Expressing the task in terms of Equation 1.1, we get:\n\\[\np(y_i = c \\vert \\mathbf{x}_i, \\pmb{\\theta}) \\propto p(\\mathbf{x}_i\\vert y_i=c, \\pmb{\\theta})p(y_i=c\\vert \\pmb{\\theta})\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nIn the equation, \\(\\pmb{\\theta}\\) is seem as\nSince we only have two classes, spam and non-spam, let us apply a builder \\(B_\\mathbb{I}: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\{0,1\\}^{|\\mathcal{V}|}\\) that transforms the data set into binary feature vectors indicating the presence or absence of each word in the vocabulary.

Assuming that all \\(x_{ij}\\) are conditionally independent given the classes \\(C\\), we can express the likelihood as: \\[\n\\forall x_a, x_b \\in \\mathbf{x}_i, x_a \\perp x_b \\vert y_i=c \\implies\\\\\np(\\mathbf{x}_i\\vert y_i=c, \\pmb{\\theta}) = \\prod_j \\theta_{jc}^{x_{ij}}(1-\\theta_{jc})^{1-x_{ij}}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nAssumption for the prior.

Equation 4.3 assumes that each class is equaly likely to show up in the population. However, this can be a too strong of an assumption for our example of sorting messages as spam and not-spam (think: are we equally likely to receive spam and non-spam messages?).\nTo compute the matrix of probabilities \\(\\pmb{\\theta}\\), we can use the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for each word \\(j\\) in the vocabulary and each class \\(c\\):\n\\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_{jc} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} x_{ij} \\mathbb{I}(y_i=c)}{\\sum_{i} \\mathbb{I}(y_i=c)}\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)\\) is the indicator function that returns 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise.\nLaplace Smoothing.

    "text": "4.2 Making Predictions\nTo make predictions on new messages, we can use the learned parameters from Table 4.3 and apply Equation 4.1.

The most glaring one is that our posteriors are extremely low, which could be a sign of numerical underflow when multiplying many small probabilities together. This is a common issue in Naive Bayes classifiers, increasing with the size of vocabulary, since all probabilities of the likelihood \\(\\sum_x p(\\mathbf{x}\\vert y)\\) should add to \\(1\\). To mitigate this, we could consider using log for out computations, as shown in the next section.\n\nChallenge 4.2 (Numerical Underflow) Numerical underflow occurs when small numbers are rounded to zero in a computer. In the context of our spam detection model, when we compute the likelihood \\(p(\\mathbf{x}_i\\vert y_i=c, \\pmb{\\theta})\\) as a product of many small probabilities (especially with a large vocabulary), the result can become so small that it is effectively treated as zero by the computer. This leads to incorrect posterior probabilities and unreliable classifications.",

    "section": "4.3 Avoiding Numerical Underflow",
    "text": "4.3 Avoiding Numerical Underflow\nTo avoid numerical underflow, we can compute the logarithm of the posterior probabilities instead of the probabilities themselves. This transforms the product of probabilities into a sum of logarithms, which is numerically more stable. The logarithm of the posterior probability can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log p(y_i = c \\vert \\mathbf{x}_i, \\pmb{\\theta}) &\\propto \\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i\\vert y_i=c, \\pmb{\\theta}) + \\log p(y_i=c\\vert \\pmb{\\theta}) \\\\\n&\\propto \\sum_j \\left[ x_{ij} \\log \\theta_{jc} + (1-x_{ij}) \\log (1-\\theta_{jc}) \\right] + \\log \\hat{\\pi}_c\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\nThat means, we can maximize the log-posterior instead of the posterior itself and use it to classify messages.
