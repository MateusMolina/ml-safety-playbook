## Multinomial Distribution
The **multinomial distribution** is a generalization of the binomial distribution. It models the probability of counts for each of $k$ different outcomes in $n$ independent trials, where each trial results in exactly one of the $k$ outcomes. Let $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k) \in \mathbf{X}$ be the vector of counts for each outcome and $\mathbf{X}$ the vector of random variables, we say that $$\mathbf{X}\sim \text{Mu}_k(n,\pmb{\theta}).$$ The probability mass function (PMF) of the multinomial distribution is given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}) &= \binom{n}{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k} \theta_1^{x_1} \theta_2^{x_2} \ldots \theta_k^{x_k}\\
&= \binom{n}{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k} \prod_{i=1}^{k} \theta_i^{x_i}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-pmf-multinomial}
where:

- $n$ is the total number of trials,
- $x_i$ is the count of occurrences of outcome $i$ (with $\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i = n$),
- $p_i$ is the probability of outcome $i$ (with $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \theta_i = 1$).
- The term $$\binom{n}{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k} \triangleq \frac{n!}{x_1! x_2! \ldots x_k!}$$ is the multinomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to arrange the counts of the different outcomes.

## 5 ones and 5 sixes in 10 rolls of a fair die
Suppose we roll a fair six-sided die 10 times. We want to find the probability of getting 5 ones and 5 sixes: 1 appears 5 times, 2 appears 0 times, 3 appears 0 times, 4 appears 0 times, 5 appears 0 times, and 6 appears 5 times.
Let $\mathbf{x} = (5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5)$ be the vector of counts for each face. Since the die is fair, the probabilities for each face are equal: $$\pmb{\theta} = \left(\frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}\right).$$
We can say that $$\mathbf{X}\sim \text{Mu}_6(10,\pmb{\theta}).$$ By applying @eq-pmf-multinomial, we can calculate the probability of observing the counts in $\mathbf{x}$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}) &= \binom{10}{5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^5 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^0 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^0 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^0 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^0 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^5\\
&= \frac{10!}{5! 0! 0! 0! 0! 5!} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{10} \approx 4.17\times 10^{-6}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

You can expect to be this unlucky about once every 240,000 times you repeat this experiment!

A special case of the multinomial distribution is the categorical distribution, which models the outcome of a single trial with $k$ possible outcomes.

## Categorical Distribution

The **categorical distribution** is a special case of the multinomial distribution where there is only one trial ($n=1$). It models the probability of each of $k$ different outcomes in a single trial. Let $X$ be a random variable representing the outcome of the trial, we say that $$X\sim \text{Cat}_k(\pmb{\theta}) \triangleq \text{Mu}_k(1,\pmb{\theta}).$$

Note that since we have just one experiment, the vector of outcomes must contain exactly one non-zero element equal to one. For example, $\mathbf{x}=(1,0,\ldots,0)$ indicates that outcome 1 occurred, $\mathbf{x}=(0,1,0,\ldots,0)$ indicates that outcome 2 occurred, and so on.
